	<h3 style="color:red;"> The Modern Diet </h3>
		<p> We live in an age of fast; fast fashion, fast technology, and fast food. The typical American diet consists
		of numerous unpleasantries healthwise, such as preservatives, pesticides and gmos. Almost, if not all, 
		fast food contains atleast one of these ingredients. Most of the time they contain them all. As for the person 
		who tries to avoid fast foods for health reasons, they find that simply avoiding fast food does not always
		work. The dietary landscape is tricky and filled with half truths and numerous fads. Who can be trusted
		when every diet claims to be backed by numerous doctors and fitness experts? What is really the healthiest
		diet?</p>

	<h3 style="color:red;">Why Avoid Fast Foods?</h3>

		types of diets out there that it can be overwhelming to find and stick to a specific one.</p>

	<h3 style="color:red;">What Consitutes a Good Diet?</h3>
		<p>A good diet can come in many different forms. Although I just mentioned that the plethora of diets available can
		be overwhelming, a good diet is not limited to only one type. So what does make a good diet? Basically, a good diet
		consists of whole and high quality foods along with mostly vegetables. This link to a Harvard research article details the 
		importance of quality over any specific type of diet: <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/healthy-weight/best-diet-quality-counts/"> The Best Diet:Quality Counts </a>
		</p>
		<p> Basically, you can use many different diets, as long as an emphasis is placed on the quality of the foods and plants
		are consumed in high amounts.</p>
